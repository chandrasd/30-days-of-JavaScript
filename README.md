# 30 days of JavaScript
Challenging myself on JavaScript for 30 days. Inspired by Wes Bos's JavaScript30.
I'm following through the JavaScript30 challenges and I'm exploring various JavaScript techniques to become a better programmer. 
## Day-1 (24th sept)
Web page with Audio buttons that reciprocate a sound from keyboard inputs (ASDF).

## Day-2 (25th sept)
Created a web page with a live clock with hour, minute and second hands.
